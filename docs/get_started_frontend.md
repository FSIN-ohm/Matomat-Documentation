Setting up the development environment
==

The following steps will guide you through the process of setting up the development environment for the admin and user-frontend.

## Step 1: Installing a suitable source code editor

We recommend using Visual Studio Code, it's available for Windows, macOS and Linux. Furthermore does it support JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js and npm package manager. All four are required.

Download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

### Step 2: Installing Node.js

Angular requires Node.js version 8.x or 10.x.

Check the version you're running: Open your command line interface (CLI), and type `node -v`

If Node.js is not installed download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Step 3: Installing the npm (Node Package Manager)

Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as npm packages (learn more [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/index.html)). To download and install npm packages, you need to have such a package manager installed.

This Quick Start uses the [npm client](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install) command line interface, which is installed with Node.js by default.

To check that you have the npm client installed, run `npm -v` in a CLI.

### Step 4: Installing the Angular CLI

The Angular CLI was used to create the Matomat.
Find out more about Angular, [here](https://angular.io/)

To install the CLI using npm, run the following command in your command line interface:

##### Windows: `npm install -g @angular/cli`

##### MacOS/Linux: `sudo npm install -g @angular/cli`

### Step 5: Cloning the Github Repository

In order to edit the project files in your chosen source editor you have to clone them from our official Github Repository.

#### Admin Frontend: [https://github.com/FSIN-ohm/Matomat-Admin-Frontend](https://github.com/FSIN-ohm/Matomat-Admin-Frontend)
#### Frontend: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [https://github.com/FSIN-ohm/Matomat-Frontend](https://github.com/FSIN-ohm/Matomat-Frontend)
</br>
Congratulation, now you should be able to open the downloaded files within your source editor.
