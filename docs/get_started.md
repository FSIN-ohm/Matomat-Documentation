Getting started
===============

Welcome to the MatÎ©hmat-Project! The Matomat is a simple to use and modifiable open source digital cash register system, designed by students from the TH-Nuernberg during the years 2018-2019.

This guide will lead you step by step through the process of setting up the development environment.

# Step 1: Installing a suitable source code editor

We recommend using Visual Studio Code, it's available for Windows, macOS and Linux. Furthermore does it support JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js and npm package manager. All four are required to edit this project.

Download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

## Windows

### Step 2: Installing Node.js

Angular requires Node.js version 8.x or 10.x

- Check your version: Open cmd or terminal, and type: `node -v`.
- Or download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Step 3: Installing the npm (Node Package Manager)

Angular, the Angular CLI, and Angular apps depend on features and functionality provided by libraries that are available as npm packages (learn more [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm/index.html)). To download and install npm packages, you need to have such a package manager installed.

This Quick Start uses the npm client (learn more about the [client](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install)) command line interface. It's installed with Node.js by default.

To check you have the npm client installed run this command in powershell or cmd: `npm -v`.

### Step 4: Installing the Angular CLI

The Angular CLI was used to create the Matomat.
Find out more about Angular, [here](https://angular.io/).

To install the CLI using npm, run this command in powershell or cmd: `npm install -g @angular/cli`

### Step 5: Cloning the git-repository
