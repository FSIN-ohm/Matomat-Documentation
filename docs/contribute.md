# Feature branching

In order to apply changes to a Matohmat repository we use a methode so called
[feature branching](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow).
By means we do not allow commits to be pushed directly to the `master` branch of any of our repositories.
Instead what you would want to do is fork our repository, work on your own fork, and if you are done send a
[Merge- or Pullrequest](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

This Merge-/Pullrequest then needs to be tested and code reviewd by another member of the matomat crew.
