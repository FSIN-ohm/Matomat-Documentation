Mat\u03a9hmat is created by and for the students of the IT-Fculty of the TH Nuermberg University. It is the successor of the k4cg Matomat and the Fablabl NBG Matomat . Mat\u03a9hmat allows users to register and have an account where they can pay money to. From this account they can then buy what is Provided by the Fachschaft . The design of the system is modern, open, and mostly designed with technologies that IT students of TH Nuermberg are able to understand. This should enable future generations of students to administrate, and extend the system with cool features. Mat\u03a9hmat consists of three major parts, a Server using MySQL to store all Persistent information, and handle Background Jobs. a web based Admin frontend with which is possible to administrate the system. a frontend based on a Raspbery PI which handles the interaction with the users. The Server The core is the Server with which all other parts of Mat\u03a9hmat communicate with through a REST-API based on the JSON protocol. The Server is written in java using the Spring Framework for providing the REST-API, and Hibernate to communicate with the MySQL database. The Admin-Fronted The Admin-Frontend is written HTML, CSS, and TypeScript using the Angular framework. It is a web application that can be delivered by a static web sever like Nginx . All the the persistent data it need it gets form the Mat\u03a9hmat Server . The User-Frontend The User-Frontend is a little wooden box containing a touch display a RaspberryPI, and a RFID scanner. It displays a touch friendly webpage hosted on the device itself. The page comunicates directly with the Mat\u03a9hmat Server through its REST-API. It is created using pure HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.","title":"Mat\u03a9hmat documentation"},{"location":"#mathmat-documentation","text":"Mat\u03a9hmat is a cash system designed to cell Mate, sweets and other joyful goods :D.

Feature branching In order to apply changes to a Matohmat repository we use a methode so called feature branching . By means we do not allow commits to be pushed directly to the master branch of any of our repositories. Instead what you would want to do is fork our repository, work on your own fork, and if you are done send a Merge- or Pullrequest . This Merge-/Pullrequest then needs to be tested and code reviewd by another member of the matomat crew.","title":"Contribute"},{"location":"contribute/#contribute","text":"This side will describe how to contribute to the Matohmat project.","title":"Contribute"},{"location":"contribute/#feature-branching","text":"In order to apply changes to a Matohmat repository we use a methode so called feature branching .
